Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
did gire and gimble in the wabe

All mimsy were the borogoves,
and the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the jabberwock, my son!
the jaws that bite, the claws that catch
Beware the jubjub bird and then
the frumious bandersnatch!

He took the vorpoal sword in hand
long time the manxome foe he sought
