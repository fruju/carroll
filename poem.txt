Twas brillig, and the slithy toves           
did gire and gimble in the wabe      

All mimsy were the borogoves,     
and the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the jabberwock, my daughter!
the jaws that bite, the claws that catch
Beware the jubjub bird and then
the frumious bandersnatch!

She took the vapor sword in hand
what was really going on here?
